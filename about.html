GCNS_main_text: Grayslake Cooperative Nursery School strives to be a quality preschool with a focus on socialization and a positive start to the school experience.  It is with commitment and dedication from  parents and teachers that children develop academically, emotionally, socially and physically in a nurturing, family focused, bright environment.  With parental involvement, it is truly a unique experience and one that will start your child on the right path to a wonderful, educational experience.
GLORYLAND_preamble: We are a state licensed preschool facility dedicated to sharing the love of Jesus with children and families that come into contact with us.
GLORYLAND_main_text: Our culturally diverse student body enjoys the academic challenges presented to them through our curriculum based program. We recognize that positive interactions and development during the preschool years are a foundation to future educational successes. We also believe spiritual needs are an element of this development. As a Christian preschool we want our children to know that they are special and loved by Jesus. This message is conveyed daily by the teaching of prayers, music, and songs at group and snack time; Bible stories in circle time as well as chapel talks with Pastor Brian.
WCA_preable: Our mission is to provide for Christian families a Christ-centered education that disciples our students to honor Jesus Christ in thought, word, and deed.
WCA_main_text: In our Preschool program, we believe that young children learn best through play and hands-on learning experiences which take place in a safe and caring environment.  It is our goal to help each child grow and develop intellectually, physically, spiritually, socially, and emotionally.  We provide a variety of developmentally appropriate learning activities each day including free play, circle time, center activities, and indoor/outdoor large muscle play.
PEPPERMINT_preamble: Peppermint Stick continues to provide high quality education and care for young children.
