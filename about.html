It is with commitment and dedication from  parents and teachers that children develop academically, emotionally, socially and physically in a nurturing, family focused, bright environment.  With parental involvement, it is truly a unique experience and one that will start your child on the right path to a wonderful, educational experience.

WCA_main_text: In our Preschool program, we believe that young children learn best through play and hands-on learning experiences which take place in a safe and caring environment.  It is our goal to help each child grow and develop intellectually, physically, spiritually, socially, and emotionally.  We provide a variety of developmentally appropriate learning activities each day including free play, circle time, center activities, and indoor/outdoor large muscle play.
