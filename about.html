          The Run For Learning 5K is an annual five kilometer race that began in 2014 as a way to raise awareness of and funds for Grayslake, IL preschools. This event is intended to provide a competitive race for athletes of all abilities as well as a family friendly atmosphere of community. Since the first race, the focus of the Run For Learning 5K has expanded to become a race that raises funds for licensed, early-education centers (providing preschool and/or kindergarten programs). Proceeds from this annual event will go to teachers at licensed early-education centers in Grayslake, IL and the surrounding area communities through a grant process.
